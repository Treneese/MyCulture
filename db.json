With 3 degrees on the frontstretch and 2 degrees on the backstretch, this track has unique characteristics that require drivers to race against the wall. As a result, drivers will earn their “Darlington Stripes” from grazing the wall through the infamous turns. The track first opened in 1950, the Cup Series held its inaugural race then and Johnny Mantz won.",
